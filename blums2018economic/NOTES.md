# Notes

This ontology contains examples of relators that should have been externally depedent modes on "Party's Right" and "Party's Obligation".

There's also an example of role mixin specializing a relator, indicating the need for roles of relators or even non-sortal relator types (see Asset Liability).

There are two large diagrams in this paper that were not represented because the classes there have basically no stereotypes, making them hard to be processed according what I want.
